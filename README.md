# Cloud Infrastructure Cost Analysis: Conceptual Framework

This conceptual project outlines a structured approach to analyzing and comparing financial implications of Cloud, On-Premises, and Hybrid IT solutions.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
- Evaluate strategic infrastructure choices using financial models.
- Identify cost-efficient solutions via TCO, NPV, Break-even Analysis.
- Provide visualizations for intuitive decision-making.

## ðŸš€ Proposed Methodology
- **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**: Aggregate costs over 5 years.
- **Net Present Value (NPV)**: Discount future costs.
- **Break-even Analysis**: Identify when costs align across solutions.

## ðŸ“ˆ Conceptual Visualizations
- Comparative Cost Analysis (Bar Chart)
- Break-even Analysis (Donut Chart)
- Interactive dashboard concept (Tableau/Power BI)

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `Financial_Model_Template.xlsx`
- `bar.png` (Cost Comparison Chart)
- `donut.png` (Break-even Analysis Chart)

## ðŸ›  Skills Demonstrated
- Financial Modeling & Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Strategic Decision-Making
- IT Infrastructure Knowledge (AWS/Azure/GCP)
